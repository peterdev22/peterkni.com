## My Website

This website is basically a 'hub' for all of my public dev projects. It's not yet finished, but will be updated whenever I do something new! Anything public, even unfinished projects are linked on this page.

All of the code is found on Github in this repository, with the website being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The font I used is called [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and it's completely open source.
