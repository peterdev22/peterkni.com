# Peter's Website

This website is basically a 'hub' for all of my public dev projects. Anything public that I've made will be listed here, including school and personal projects.

The framework used is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and it's been very fun to use so far.

All of the code is found on Github in this repository, with the website being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The font I used is called [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and it's completely open source.
