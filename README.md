This website is basically a 'hub' for all of my public projects relating to CAD, robotics and programming. Anything public that I've made will be listed here, including school and personal projects.

The framework used is [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and it's been very fun to use so far. I'm also using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to manage styles. All of the code is found on Github in this repository, with the website being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Thanks for visiting!
