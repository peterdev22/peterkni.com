# Peter's Website

This website is basically a 'hub' for all of my public dev projects. Anything public that I've made will be listed here, including school and personal projects.

All of the code is found on Github in this repository, with the website being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The font I used is called [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and it's completely open source.
